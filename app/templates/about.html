    <h2>About Releasarr</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Releasarr is a self-hosted application designed to help you manage your music library by tracking artists and their releases.
        Think of it as a personal "Lidarr replacement" that allows you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add and manage your favorite artists.</li>
        <li>Fetch release information from various external sources like MusicBrainz, Discogs, and Deezer.</li>
        <li>Organize and view details about each release, including tracks, year, and cover art.</li>
        <li>Keep your release data updated and consistent.</li>
        <li>Receive notifications about new releases or important events via configurable services like Apprise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project aims to provide a lightweight and customizable solution for music enthusiasts who prefer to have more control
        over their collection management.
